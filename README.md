Rabins Record Label is fictional Record Label based on music industry and the website I have built is for this record label. The website is fully mobile responsive and have other major accessibility features like small and large font sizes, light, and dark themes. The website has eight main interfaces, they are Home, Music, Studio, Events, About, Contact, Register and Login Page. The interface of Home page has most of the major features provided by the website as it works as landing page of the website.

In the Music interface, user can listen to their favorite music recommended by the system. The Studio page has details about all the featured and signed artist the record label has along with the gallery of recent studio events. Similarly, the Events interface has information about the recent event related to studio artists and there is also interface for users to book shows with the studio or their favorite artists. The Connect menu has two interfaces linked to it and they are About and Contact Pages.
The interface of About page has all the information about the Record label and Contact page allows user to give feedback message and has contact details. And finally, Register and Login interface is for user registration and login, respectively.
Finally, for the development I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have built website for dark theme, light theme, small font, and large font for making it more accessible to users. All the pages are mobile responsive too.

### Design Process

I made a rough sketch on my paper and made some corrections and finalized them. After that I made wireframe designs for every page following my rough draft from paper.
Once my wireframes were ready, I picked color that will match my system. Since it is about music and events, I picked vibrant colors from COOLERS. After that, I made different logo designs for my website and finalized one which is shown below.

The following are the color palettes that I picked for my logo design and later used them for overall prototypes and development.
